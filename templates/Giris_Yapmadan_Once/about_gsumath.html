    <p class="text-left text-black font-headers-2">GSU MATH is a social network prepared for mathematics students of Galatasaray University. Thanks to this network, students will be able to easily share their course notes, textbooks and many more.</p>
    <p class="text-left text-black font-headers-2">During semesters, the flow of lessons can vary considerably as a result of different teachers coming to the same courses every year. Due to this reason, we are making this social network.
        Now, students will be able to publish course notes and many more for specific teacher/course combination. Everyone has specific flow for his own, which flows with their interested courses. Thanks to this social network, for example a Licence 1 student will be able to see
    Licence 2,3,4 and 1 course notes. We hope this will improve success ratio of anyone.</p>
    <p class="text-left text-black font-headers-2">This website is totally free to use. We hope adding TypeLATEX feature to the website in future.</p>
